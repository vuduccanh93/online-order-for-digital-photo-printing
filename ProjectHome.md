“MyImage” is a group of people who wants to develop an online
site were the user can upload his or her photographs and can order
them for printing. A customer can have a set of digital photographs
in his desktop which he/she wants to print. He/she can provide the
application the path to the folder where the photographs are stored
and can choose the photos that he/she wants to print and choose
the size of the prints. The application will calculate the price after
downloading the price information from the database for the different
print sizes and show it to the user. The user will enter his/her credit
card/other payment option (or choose any other mode of payment)
and shipping information if he/she wants to go ahead with the order. If
the credit card information is found correct, the photos are uploaded to
the server and a purchase order is created in the database.
